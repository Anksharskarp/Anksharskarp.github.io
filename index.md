## Mobile Development, Modding, and Competitive Programming

### Introduction

I am a student developer with extensive experience in Android and iOS app development. In addition, I also have experience in web scraping and data science with Python, in particular with the Pandas, Numpy, and BeautifulSoup code libraries for data aggregation, web scraping, and data analysis.

A few years ago, I founded [Artics Engineering](https://github.com/ArticsData), a software organization that develops innovative new products for the future.

For my local community, I have volunteered for HelpForStudents, which provides free tutoring services to students for all subjects, including computer science. 

Currently, I am building software projects for the Greater Boston community in the [Lexington Youth STEAM Team](http://youthsteaminitiative.org), which uses computer science technologies to strengthen the bonds of the community.

In my free time, I mod Minecraft using Forge and FabricMC, play the violin, and run cross country and track. I also experiment with Raspberry Pi automation and Ubuntu Web Servers. Recently, I've built platform-agnostic web services with React Native and ReactJS.
