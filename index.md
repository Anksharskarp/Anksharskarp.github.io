## Personal Portfolio

### Introduction

I am a freshman at Lexington High School in Lexington, Massachusetts. I have extensive experience with the Java programming language, having built Android mobile applications with the language. In addition, I also have experience in web scraping and data science with Python, in particular with the Pandas, Numpy, and BeautifulSoup code libraries for data aggregation, web scraping, and data analysis.
On top of this, I am also the founder of [Argentable](argentable.github.io), an open-source software organization that develops apps for fitness, entertainment, and productivity.
For my local community, I have volunteered for [HelpForStudents](helpforstudents.org), which provides free tutoring services to students for all subjects, including computer science. 
In my free time, I mod Minecraft using Forge and FabricMC, play the violin, and run cross country. I also do Public Policy Debate on my high school team.
